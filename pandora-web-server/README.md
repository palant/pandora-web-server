# Pandora Web Server

This is a modular web server, supporting different configurations per host name and subpath.

## Features

* Flexible configuration via one or multiple YAML files
* Basic configurations possible via command-line options
* Built on Cloudflareâ€™s fast Pingora framework
* Flexible selection of modules to add to the build
* Easy to create an own build with custom modules

### Modules

* **Auth**: Puts parts of the webspace behind an authentication wall. Supports page-based
  logins (recommended) and HTTP Basic authentication.
* **Common Log**: Access logging using [Common Log
  Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Log_Format), fields to be logged are
  configurable.
* **Compression**: Dynamic compression of server responses and (if necessary) decompression of
  upstream responses.
* **Headers**: Structured configuration of `Cache-Control` and `Content-Security-Policy`
  headers, supports adding custom response headers.
* **IP Anonymization**: Removes part of the IP address, making sure no personal data is
  collected here.
* **Rewrite**: Flexible rules allowing internal or external redirection of requests.
* **Static Files**: Serves static files from a directory, supports pre-compressed files.
* **Startup**: Listening on any number of IP addresses/ports, TLS support, automatic
  redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS.
* **Upstream**: Delegates the request to an upstream HTTP server.
* **Virtual Hosts**: Separate configurations per host name and (optionally) subpaths within a
  host.

## Configuration

The default preset puts the configuration for Startup, IP Anonymization and Headers modules at
the top level, all other modules are configured per host name. A configuration file could look
like this then:

```yaml
# Startup module settings (https://docs.rs/startup-module/latest/startup_module/struct.StartupConf.html)
listen:
- "[::]:8080"
daemon: false

# IP Anonymization module settings (https://docs.rs/ip-anonymization-module/latest/ip_anonymization_module/struct.IPAnonymizationConf.html)
anonymization_enabled: true

# Headers module settings (https://docs.rs/headers-module/latest/headers_module/struct.HeadersConf.html)
response_headers:
    custom:
    - Server: "My server is the best"

# Virtual hosts settings:
# * https://docs.rs/virtual-hosts-module/latest/virtual_hosts_module/struct.VirtualHostsConf.html
# * https://docs.rs/log-module/latest/log_module/struct.LogConf.html
# * https://docs.rs/compression-module/latest/compression_module/struct.CompressionConf.html
# * https://docs.rs/auth-module/latest/auth_module/struct.AuthConf.html
# * https://docs.rs/rewrite-module/latest/rewrite_module/struct.RewriteConf.html
# * https://docs.rs/upstream-module/latest/upstream_module/struct.UpstreamConf.html
# * https://docs.rs/static-files-module/latest/static_files_module/struct.StaticFilesConf.html
vhosts:
    [localhost:8080, 127.0.0.1:8080, "[::1]:8080"]:
        root: ./local-debug-root
    example.com:
        default: true
        compression_level_gzip: 3
        compression_level_brotli: 3
        compression_level_zstd: 3
        root: ./production-root
```

Example config files for this preset are provided in this directory.

## Building and running the web server

To create a release build with the default features, run the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

You can also run a debug build with the example configuration files from this directory:

```sh
cargo run -- -c "config/*.yaml"
```

To enable debugging output you can use the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```sh
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- -c "config/*.yaml"
```

You can find more information on the `RUST_LOG` environment variable in the [documentation of
the `env_logger` crate](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/).

## Selecting other features

In additions to the default features, the preset `default-single-host` is also available. It
can be built with the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features=default-single-host
```

The resulting web server will have no host-based configuration, all modules are to be
configured at the top level.

Features of this crate also allow selecting for each module whether it should be used at the
top level or in a per-host configuration:

| Module            | Top-level feature             | Per-host feature              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Auth              | `auth-top-level`              | `auth-per-host`               |
| Common Log        | `common-log-top-level`        | `common-log-per-host`         |
| Compression       | `compression-top-level`       | `compression-per-host`        |
| Headers           | `headers-top-level`           | `headers-per-host`            |
| IP Anonymization  | `ip-anonymization-top-level`  | `ip-anonymization-per-host`   |
| Rewrite           | `rewrite-top-level`           | `rewrite-per-host`            |
| Static Files      | `static-files-top-level`      | `static-files-per-host`       |
| Upstream          | `upstream-top-level`          | `upstream-per-host`           |

For example, if your server only needs to serve static files and write access logs, you can
build it with the following command:

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features=static-files-top-level,common-log-top-level
```

The Startup module is always present at the top level, and the Virtual Hosts module is added
automatically if any per-host feature is enabled.

*Note*: It is technically possible to include a module both at the top and per-host level. It
will be configurable on both levels then. Whether this approach makes sense and how the two
module instances will interact with each other is a different question however. Such setups are
unsupported.
